## 🎮 How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
streamlit run optimized_app.py
```

## 🔧 Technical Optimizations

### MediaPipe Settings
```python
# Optimized for speed and efficiency
mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose.Pose(
    model_complexity=1,           # Balanced accuracy/speed
    enable_segmentation=False,    # Disabled for performance
    min_detection_confidence=0.5, # Reasonable threshold
    min_tracking_confidence=0.5   # Smooth tracking
)
```

### Video Processing
